      <p className="mb-4 text-slate-700">
        EstatesHere is a real estate platform designed to connect property
        owners with buyers and renters. Whether you're selling, renting, or
        searching for a property, EstatesHere simplifies the process by allowing
        users to list properties or search for them using various filters,
        including property type, offer type: sale or rent, parking availability,
        and furnished status. While financial transactions are not handled on
        the platform, users can easily get in touch with the property owners
        directly through the listings, making communication smooth and
        straightforward.
